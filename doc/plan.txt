    - Compare your likes to others
    - Chord namer

    - A song has a name, artist, time signature and many chords
    - A chord has a chord type and a chord length (in terms of bars)
    - A chord type has a root and then many other notes played in respect to the root

    - Query user for song name and artist
    - Save to a song object
